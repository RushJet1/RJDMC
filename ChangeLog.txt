-first play of a file will no longer cut off the beginning of the sample sometimes
-fixed several issues related to chaning Pitch settings
  -program won't crash when you change pitch then tilt
  -viewing window will not change when changing pitch
  -prevented wav file from being repitched whenever a tilt happens (stopped by previous crash)
-labels do not overlap counters in wine anymore

1.53 public

-opening .dmc and .wav files directly will properly show the program on top of other windows and in focus
-caps in the file extension while opening files "with" RJDMC will no longer say they are not supported
-changed UI label on "save split dmc" button
-Split DMC saving now shows how many frames the split DMC will run for and will calculate the size automatically based on frames and hz rate

1.52 public

-you can open .wav files directly by associating them to RJDMC in windows now
-fixed "open with" threading issue crash (only on opening files by associating them to RJDMC)

1.51 public

-fixed ssrc "<smaller of two rates>/gcd(rate,33144) %2 %3 = 0" bug
-removed hacky old fix for the above
-edited the way files are saved
-removed admin UAC requirement
-drag and drop works more consistently

1.4 public

- You can now associate DMC files with RJDMC for double-clicking
- Fixed issues with window order when double clicking files
- Added new program icon
- Added .dmc file icon
- Got rid of adding proper 16+1 byte lengths at end of files
- RJDMC no longer crashes if you open a file that's already open somewhere else.
- RJDMC tells you when you have a text output that's too large for Famitracker to import.
- Writing a .txt file for FT to import will now overwrite existing files with the same name.

1.3 public

- Added the ability to save larger DPCMs as famitracker-importable text files.

1.2 public

- "Tilt" values can be negative now.
- All non-text areas become active when moused over.
- Saving .dmc and .wav files correctly shows the current filename.
- SSRC is now included in the RJDMC executable, so no need to have it in its own folder.

1.1 public

- .wav opening fixes

1.041 private

- Fixed cut/copy/paste/trim/delete so that they no longer crash if the file is too small (one sample)


1.04 public

- Added tilt feature
- Fixed a bug where hitting revert crashes program before a .wav is loaded
- Fixed several bugs with tilt


v1.03 public

- Minimizing the window when a .wav file is open no longer crashes RJDMC


v1.02 public

-Reiterates current working directory for Windows XP (ssrc use)
-Changes current working directory to the correct one if an outside program opens it


v1.01 public

- Fixed some specific graphical glitches with resizing
- Editing the zoomed-in portions of the wav shouldn't screw up as long as the wave's zoom isn't already messed up :P

v1.0 public

- Fixed a bug with selections not actually being the correct size that is selected (mostly unnoticeable)
- Fixed Wave hz rates being incorrectly converted by ssrc
- Fixed a glitch where ssrc would sometimes process waves in 8-bit mode (used double precision)


v0.9 public

-Zoom into any area is done
-Operations on zoomed selections are possible
-Modify volume for selection
-Fade volume to x%
-Fixed several bugs, made tons of optimizations (mostly to new functions)
-Zooming on large files is faster

v0.6 Public

-Added a reverse function
-Data is read in almost 2x as fast
-Quality of "rate" changes is much higher
-Added extra error handling for non-pcm and non-wav files
-Fixed several bugs
-Added "play selection" feature
-DPCM output is always (mod16 + 1) bytes, so looping is more accurate
-Fixed a few of the keypresses not being read properly
-Various improvements to code efficiency
-Fixed all bugs with the trackbars (all scroll 1-per-tick)


v0.4 Public

-Pitch is implemented
-Deleting selection is implemented
-Fixed several bugs related to the highlighting of the window
-Fixed bugs involving space bar triggering controls
-Fixed bugs with lower HZ samples crashing SSRC (small files)
-Implemented Cut, Copy, Paste, Trim, Select All, Delete

NOTES: 
-Zoom function doesn't work with editing the wave file yet (it acts as if you're zoomed all the way out).
-You can either right click on the wave display or use shortcuts to use the editor functionality.
	-CTRL+V = paste, CTRL+C = copy, CTRL+X = cut, CTRL+T = trim, CTRL+Z = revert, CTRL+A = select all
-"quality" Pitch change right now is a bit mediocre quality-wise.  I might just have lots of copies of each .wav file in memory for small files.


v0.32 Public 

-Any rate of input wave is supported (approximated to the nearest frequency SSRC can handle)
-DMC drag 'n drop implemented
-DMC batch processing implemented

v0.31 Public

-Very small .wav files work properly with SSRC now.
-When SSRC is missing, an error is generated and the program properly halts.

v0.3 Public

-Memory use is cut way down (for large files)
-Bit Crushing is implemented (0 is off, 1-19 is varying degrees of bits flipped, and 20 is an inverted waveform).
-Volume control is implemented (volume for the input wave is changed by x%).
-Zoom is implemented on the waveform view--unfortunately it only zooms to the middle now.
-You can highlight parts of the wave in the waveform view but it doesn't do anything.
-Pitch control is done, and playback is at least pretty close to how the NES would handle it, though not exact.
-Opening DMC files is possible now, and you can edit them just like .wav files.
-Several bugs were fixed, most of which most people wouldn't notice.


v0.2 (private)
-Started several of the features that are finished in v0.3.
-Preview ability is threaded
-Toolbar buttons are functional


v0.1 Public
-New GUI
-Added waveform view of DPCM
-Added preview ability (currently does not stop on file open)
-Added some toolbar buttons, only a couple do anything.


DMC_EDITOR (RJDMCv0.05)

-Converts .wav files to .dmc
-Displays information about incoming .wav
-.wav files must be greater than 33144hz, and they are resampled poorly.
